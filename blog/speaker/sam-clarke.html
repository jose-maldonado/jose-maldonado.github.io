    <h2>Who is Sam Clarke?</h2>
    <p>I'm a former Biologists (Degrees in Microbiology and Toxicology) who evolved into a programmer. An evolution which was cemented when I encountered Python.

I spent several years working with the Charles Darwin Foundation in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador where I built a number of apps showcasing data from Taxonomy to Meteorology. Some of these are even still online. I gave a lightning talk at Pycon US 2012 describing how we were using Python at the Foundation.

For the last 4 years I have worked with Rival Schools in Vancouver, helping transition the company from an agency model to developing their own applications  primarily for the entertainment industry. One of these applications is Script Speaker, which converts movie scripts to audio files with full part casting.

I currently live on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, Canada, with my wife and our crazy sheep dog.
