    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'm all about efficiency. Not just code execution efficiency, but also regarding my work tools, and my usage of them.

Having been an avid programmer and Linux user for several years now, and being obsessed with my workflow efficiency, I've amassed a pretty good understanding of how to improve productivity when it comes to writing code.
From small but powerful configurations for my text editor that took me weeks to find to some not-so-well-known tools, I'm always thinking about how I can tweak my environment and workflow to perfection.
Have you ever considered how many keys you hit during the day? And how can you go about minimizing that and train your muscle memory to make you more efficient?
And what about that thing you're not even noticing you're spending so much time on, and that you could improve on?

This talk will feature some practical advice using my tools of choice (mostly Linux, tmux & Vim), and where applicable, all examples will be adapted to Python development.
The goal is not to try to tell you what to use, though. Instead, I want to show you a different perspective, and hopefully make you more aware of your efficiency, and of how you can improve it.</p>

    <h2>Who is Miguel Palhas?</h2>
    <p>I’ve made a jump from High-Performance Computing researcher to Web Developer, where I’ve been happily hacking for the past few years now, mostly writing Ruby and some awesome web animations.

I have a passion for Open-source, and for giving back to the community. That’s why I’ve taught programming to hundreds of people (between meetups, university courses, 1-1 mentoring, and even our coding school), and have helped organize several local Meetups.

My company, Subvisual, is the sole organizer of RubyConf Portugal and MirrorConf.

When I’m not busy building web products or bothering others with my teachings, I might be trying to become a real game developer. Being an astronaut is no longer an option, so that’s the one childhood dream I still have going on.</p>
