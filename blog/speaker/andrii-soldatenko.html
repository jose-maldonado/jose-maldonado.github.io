    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The world is swimming in articles and books about Django and Django ORM itself. All this sources cover only basic use cases of Django ORM comparing to real world examples.
This talk is dedicated to the proposition to crash test Django ORM 80% of functionalities in 20% of the time.  Also I’m going to show the important features and capabilities of Django ORM compare to most of SQL features. Traditionally, ORM is presented in a “bottom-up” fashion, but I would like to propose approach, on the other hand, is “top-down”. We begin by identifying a rather short list of standard questions, or precisely types of questions, that are often asked of relations databases. We then show how these standard questions are posted in Django ORM, introducing and motivating the use of its capabilities and features as they become relevant. </p>
