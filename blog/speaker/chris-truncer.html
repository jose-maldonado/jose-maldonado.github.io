    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Development began in late 2012, but the problem really has been a thorn in our side for quite some time.  Penetration testers, red teamers, and offensive security professionals have been frustrated with antivirus for as long as we can remember.  Professional malware and exploit kit developers can bypass antivirus solutions with ease, so why can’t the white hat industry?  Well, it turns out we can, but there’s never been an open source option.  This is where Veil-Evasion steps in.

I, along with others, began researching different methods to evade antivirus, and found a python solution!  One thing that we noticed, is that no matter how malicious we made our tool, antivirus continued to ensure us that we were safe :).  After nearly one year of having open sourced our solution Veil-Evasion, our python-based malware had its first signature.  Close to thirty minutes later, this “malware signature” was trivially bypassed by Veil-Evasion for the continued generation of “safe” executables.

I plan on elaborating on how a single python script has transformed into a framework for generating antivirus evading executables. This is the story all about how individuals have been playing the cat and mouse game with the multi-million dollar antivirus industry, and haven’t been batted around yet.  One day the antivirus industry will utilize better detection methods for malware, but today is not that day.</p>
