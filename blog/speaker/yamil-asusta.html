    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Companies often spend many engineering cycles trying to get their operations (CI, deployments, infrastructure, etc) right from the first time. On the other hand, there are those who acquire this technical debt since day one. There are those who get a dedicated DevOps individual to tackle this. Via this talk I'll cover the different trade offs and compromises an organization should take into account before investing (or not) into these aspects of their organization. </p>
