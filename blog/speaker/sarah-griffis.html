    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As our small team grew into a medium sized engineering team, we found a number of challenges in our dev process.  In particular keeping track of what Trello tickets had been deployed (and when) became cumbersome for both developers and product managers.  Using Python scripts integrated with our Ansible integration, we were able to streamline our dev and product process through a few simple steps:
1.  tag cards that had been deployed
2.  create clearly labeled columns in Trello
3. post deploy notes in Slack
4. make a few other helpful improvements to our dev process. 

In this talk, I will go through our Python scripts and various API resources needed to create tooling around dev process. I will walk through using Python in Jupyter notebooks, locally, and on production devOps boxes hosted on AWS.</p>
