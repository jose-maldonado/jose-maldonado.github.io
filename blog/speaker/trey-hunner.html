    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you've ever found unreadable PEP8-compliant code and wondered how to fix it, this talk is for you.

Long-lived code must be maintainable and readability is a prerequisite of maintainability.  It's easier to identify unreadable code than it is to create readable code.

Let's talk about how to create readable code.

During this talk we'll discuss:

- whitespace
- self-documenting code
- modularity
- expectation management

We'll conclude this talk with a checklist of questions you can use to make your own code more readable.</p>
