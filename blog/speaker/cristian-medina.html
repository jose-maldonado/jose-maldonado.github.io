    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Staring at my coworkers, already knowing the inevitability of the situation, my eyes roll as the argument ensues yet again: “I told you I can write that code twice as fast, in half as many lines and they’ll be cleaner and more readable than yours will ever be! Python is awesome!” — said the one guy.
“Whatever you say, you’ll never be able to make a UI that’s half as good as this. It won’t look pretty and no one will want to use it!” — replied the other — “Probably can’t even make it run on Windows” — he mumbled to himself while walking away.

Some years ago this was a regular exchange between coworkers, and while they were mostly messing around, there was still an element of truth to it. Regardless of its capabilities, Python was mostly known as a “scripting” language — not really for graphical interfaces — and the world was still looking for a native OS feel in their GUI applications, which was not really accessible from Python without a lot of work.

Where are we now with user interfaces? How does this picture look like for Python? Where do we want to be? How can we best leverage the technologies of today? Where should we improve? What can we do so that Python is ready for the future of user interfaces? These are some of the questions that I'd like to start answering.

    <h2>Who is Cristian Medina?</h2>
    <p>Born in the Dominican Republic, I went to college at UPR Mayagüez for Computer Engineering and spent the next 14 years in some sort of test engineering role, where I've developed hardware and software tooling to help enable cross-geographical organizations to plan, execute, manage and monitor their operations as needed. I've worked with many programming languages developing all sorts of applications from low-level software that interacts directly with firmware, to infrastructure services applications, all the way up to higher level business apps. Throughout my journeys, Python has been - and continues to be - my language of choice. </p>
