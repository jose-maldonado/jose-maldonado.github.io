    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>New open source communities are born everyday. Some of them are meant to last long and some others aren't. There's a moment in every community when it needs to outgrow itself, expand its limits and aim way higher than ever. This is no necessarily related to its goals but the ecosystem it needs to stay alive.

Once a community has gone beyond its limits, the community members, consumers and leaders will have to keep up with its pace. How do we help it to remain sane? How do we keep our goals on track while allowing for further growth? How do we allow it to keep expanding without further damaging the community?

These are all questions we ask ourselves everyday in the OpenStack community and that we've managed to work on without killing ourselves on the way.</p>

    <h2>Who is Flavio Percoco?</h2>
    <p>

Prior to Red Hat, Flavio worked on Big Data oriented applications, search engines and message systems. He was also an active member of Gnome's a11y team where he contributed to Orca and created MouseTrap, a head-tracker application. Outside Red Hat Flavio likes to take run, travel, hang around with family and friends and whatever seems interesting.

Flavio spends most of his time hacking on containers and messaging technologies in the OpenStack community where he's been part of several technical communities, served as a PTL and also as a Technical Committee member (where he still seats and contributes to).
