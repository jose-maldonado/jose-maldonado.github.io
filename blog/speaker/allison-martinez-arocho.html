    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This workshop is for people who would like to explore artistic expression through the use of a programming language, or people who are interested in creative forms of data visualization. By the end of this workshop you will have created data-driven, generative art using Python. In this workshop, you will learn how to: use Processing in Python mode, identify APIs that provide useful data for creating generative art, and create a unique work of art by calling a weather API and defining an original generative art algorithm. Please bring a laptop to participate in the hands-on activities.</p>
