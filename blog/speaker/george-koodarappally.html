    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this talk is to introduce the audience to a sampling of the various components that go into an **Inernet-of-Things (IoT)** solution. We delve into an example that uses an embedded microprossor board containing the **ESP8266 WiFi** chipset running **MicroPython**, which is interfaced to a few sensors. We also introduce the audience to the use of the **MQTT** protocol and the use of a **MQTT Message Broker**.

The example demonstrates the connection of a **remote embedded processor to a local WiFi access point**, connection to an **MQTT Message Broker** through an **MQTT client** library, **capture of data from connected sensors** and the subsequent **upload of the measured data** to a server using the MQTT messaging protocol.

    <h2>Who is George Koodarappally?</h2>
    <p>I am a hobbyist dabbling in the world of IoT. Over the past 6 months I have become fascinated with the Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32 family of WiFi chipsets. In my day job I provide corporations with enterprise solutions while in my spare time I indulge in minor hacking with microprocessor boards such as the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Adafruit Feather, Sparkfun Thing, etc. Python has made working with these devices much more easier than having to learn the deep intricasies of the C/C++ tool chains otherwise needed.

The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has piqued my interest and I have been diving deep into the various components of such solutions.
