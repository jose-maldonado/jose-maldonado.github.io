    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This talk covers two tools for securing your users' data while developing a public API.
(1) getting a free HTTPS cert with LetsEncrypt's Python CLI
(2) the Paillier cryptosystem - develop APIs which can work on users' encrypted data, without accessing the unencrypted numbers. As an example, you could develop an exchange-rate API without sharing transaction details.</p>
