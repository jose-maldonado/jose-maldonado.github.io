By the end of this workshop you will have created data-driven, generative art using Python. In this workshop, you will learn how to: use Processing in Python mode, identify APIs that provide useful data for creating generative art, and create a unique work of art by calling a weather API and defining an original generative art algorithm. Please bring a laptop to participate in the hands-on activities.",

And then, there is impostor syndrome, where one may feel like they don\u2019t deserve the help.\r\nIn this talk, I will provide advice about working with a mentor.\r\nAsking for help is not a failure. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk is for members of Python and open source community who are looking for a mentor, and needing clues as to how to find a good mentor. Those who are hesitant to ask for help may get the encouragement to reach out. Current mentors will gain insight about what their mentees are going through.",

Which should be an indication as to the wonderful potential for both business and those learning to code. Yet what often follows such statements are not words of joy but rather a list of frustrations related to the difficulty in finding and retaining enough skilled developers to fill these positions. \r\nThe challenge is not in the number of newbies entering the field but the number who leave because they are not able to bridge the divide between bootcamps, online tutorials, books, videos, etc. to an employable developer who is able to contribute to the team. \r\nKim has years of experience working with learners of various ages in helping them develop the skills they needed to be successful at whatever their chosen goal. She understands that for businesses to be successful, they must develop more effective and efficient ways of recruiting and retaining developers in order to meet organizational benchmarks. \r\nThe developer community is a overwhelmingly generous one and a well designed mentoring or apprenticeship program could be one answer that business leaders and newbies are looking for.\r\n\r\n- The business costs associated with corporate hiring managers inability to recruit and retain skilled workers to fill current and future entry-level positions are increasing (Queen, 2014). \r\n- 89 percent of organizational leaders stated that they are having difficulties filling open positions, which is causing them to either turn down orders, miss key deliverable deadlines or hire individuals from outside of the United States (Aho, 2015). \r\n\r\nAho, K.

Penetration testers, red teamers, and offensive security professionals have been frustrated with antivirus for as long as we can remember.  Professional malware and exploit kit developers can bypass antivirus solutions with ease, so why can\u2019t the white hat industry?  Well, it turns out we can, but there\u2019s never been an open source option.  This is where Veil-Evasion steps in.\r\n\r\nI, along with others, began researching different methods to evade antivirus, and found a python solution!  One thing that we noticed, is that no matter how malicious we made our tool, antivirus continued to ensure us that we were safe :).  After nearly one year of having open sourced our solution Veil-Evasion, our python-based malware had its first signature.  Close to thirty minutes later, this \u201cmalware signature\u201d was trivially bypassed by Veil-Evasion for the continued generation of \u201csafe\u201d executables.\r\n\r\nI plan on elaborating on how a single python script has transformed into a framework for generating antivirus evading executables. This is the story all about how individuals have been playing the cat and mouse game with the multi-million dollar antivirus industry, and haven\u2019t been batted around yet.  One day the antivirus industry will utilize better detection methods for malware, but today is not that day.",

    "description": "I'm all about efficiency. Not just code execution efficiency, but also regarding my work tools, and my usage of them.\r\n\r\nHaving been an avid programmer and Linux user for several years now, and being obsessed with my workflow efficiency, I've amassed a pretty good understanding of how to improve productivity when it comes to writing code.\r\nFrom small but powerful configurations for my text editor that took me weeks to find to some not-so-well-known tools, I'm always thinking about how I can tweak my environment and workflow to perfection.\r\nHave you ever considered how many keys you hit during the day? And how can you go about minimizing that and train your muscle memory to make you more efficient?\r\nAnd what about that thing you're not even noticing you're spending so much time on, and that you could improve on?\r\n\r\nThis talk will feature some practical advice using my tools of choice (mostly Linux, tmux & Vim), and where applicable, all examples will be adapted to Python development.\r\nThe goal is not to try to tell you what to use, though. Instead, I want to show you a different perspective, and hopefully make you more aware of your efficiency, and of how you can improve it.",
    "bio": "I\u2019ve made a jump from High-Performance Computing researcher to Web Developer, where I\u2019ve been happily hacking for the past few years now, mostly writing Ruby and some awesome web animations.\r\n\r\nI have a passion for Open-source, and for giving back to the community. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve taught programming to hundreds of people (between meetups, university courses, 1-1 mentoring, and even our coding school), and have helped organize several local Meetups.\r\n\r\nMy company, Subvisual, is the sole organizer of RubyConf Portugal and MirrorConf.\r\n\r\nWhen I\u2019m not busy building web products or bothering others with my teachings, I might be trying to become a real game developer. Being an astronaut is no longer an option, so that\u2019s the one childhood dream I still have going on.",

On the other hand, there are those who acquire this technical debt since day one. There are those who get a dedicated DevOps individual to tackle this. Via this talk I'll cover the different trade offs and compromises an organization should take into account before investing (or not) into these aspects of their organization. ",

    "description": "Staring at my coworkers, already knowing the inevitability of the situation, my eyes roll as the argument ensues yet again: \u201cI told you I can write that code twice as fast, in half as many lines and they\u2019ll be cleaner and more readable than yours will ever be! Python is awesome!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200asaid the one guy.\r\n\u201cWhatever you say, you\u2019ll never be able to make a UI that\u2019s half as good as this. It won\u2019t look pretty and no one will want to use it!\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200areplied the other\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cProbably can\u2019t even make it run on Windows\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ahe mumbled to himself while walking away.\r\n\r\nSome years ago this was a regular exchange between coworkers, and while they were mostly messing around, there was still an element of truth to it. Regardless of its capabilities, Python was mostly known as a \u201cscripting\u201d language\u200a\u2014\u200anot really for graphical interfaces\u200a\u2014\u200aand the world was still looking for a native OS feel in their GUI applications, which was not really accessible from Python without a lot of work.\r\n\r\nWhere are we now with user interfaces? How does this picture look like for Python? Where do we want to be? How can we best leverage the technologies of today? Where should we improve? What can we do so that Python is ready for the future of user interfaces? These are some of the questions that I'd like to start answering.\r\n",

I've worked with many programming languages developing all sorts of applications from low-level software that interacts directly with firmware, to infrastructure services applications, all the way up to higher level business apps. Throughout my journeys, Python has been - and continues to be - my language of choice. ",
